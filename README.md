# Final Project: Information Retrieval and Web Analytics 

In this project we were asked to collect data from Twitter, build a search engine, and answer 3 research questions. The topic that we selected to perform our work is Covid-19.


Getting started
------
Download a copy of this repository. Extract the zip file and rename it to *FinalProject*. If not existent, create a directory in your root Google Drive named *IRWA* and upload the *FinalProject* directory to it.The path to the repository folder should be */content/drive/My Drive/IRWA/FinalProject/*

Also, go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K2fq_juqM5T0HRaHYtargFjzrHFyniOT?usp=sharing and right click on the data directory. Add a shortcut to this folder inside the *FinalProject* directory, or simply download the files and add them to a data directory inside *FinalProject*. The path to the data should be */content/drive/My Drive/IRWA/FinalProject/data/*


The expected directory structure is the following:
